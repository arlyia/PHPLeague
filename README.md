# PHPLeague
PHP site to fetch and return information about summoner profiles in League of Legends. Connects to Discord_LiveLeague to supply it with information to return to Discord

Input the summoner name in the name field and select the region the summoner is on (e.g. "Dyrus" and "North America")
Information will be returned, likely with a database connect error but this is expected as it has not yet been implemented.

A PRIVATE API KEY IS NECESSARY TO RUN THIS SITE CORRECTLY. You can get one from developer.riotgames.com for your own use, it is against the terms to share an API key and it expires after 24 hours.
